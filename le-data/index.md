header="Living Earth constructs land cover maps according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) from environmental descriptors with pre-defined categories or units (e.g., metres, percent, time).  Overarching Environmental Descriptors (OEDs) are used to generate up to eight of the base level (LCCS Level 3) classes, with further detail added using Essential Environmental Descriptors (EEDs). The resulting maps can potentially represent over 12,000 classes with each having biophysical meaning.  Theses are further described using Additional Environmental Descriptors (AEDs), which are not part of the FAO LCCS. These can be divided into abiotic, biotic and human-influenced AEDs with examples being soil acidity, dominant plant species and urban density respectively."

subheading="Our approach to consistent mapping land cover from Earth observations was conceptualised through collaborations between Australia and Europe (including the United Kingdom) and national application was first demonstrated for Wales (UK) and Australia. Time-series comparisons of the land cover maps and the environmental descriptors from which they were constructed led to the subsequent development of evidence-based detection and monitoring of change impacts and driving pressures. "

subheading2= "Living Earth continues to evolve through national and international contributions that ensure continued research and development in the use of Earth observations for land characterisation, mapping and monitoring. "

subheading="Our approach to consistent mapping land cover from Earth observations was conceptualised through collaborations between Australia and Europe (including the United Kingdom) and national application was demonstrated for Wales (UK) and Australia. Time-series comparisons of the land cover maps and the environmental descriptors from which they were constructed led to the development of evidence-based detection and monitoring of change impacts and driving pressures.  Living Earth was implemented within the Open Data Cube although is adaptable for use with other computing infrastrutures."

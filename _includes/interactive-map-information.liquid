          Our Interactive map of the country provides a platform for visualizing how people and nature have shaped the
          landscapes we see today. These maps have been obtained primarily from historical satellite data and are
          updated through near daily observations.

          Initially, select the broad land cover as the base map, and then add layers that represent different
          categorical (e.g., crop type) or continuous (e.g., water persistence, above ground biomass) environmental
          descriptors to give more detail. See the video for a

          View maps of habitat extent (for Wales only), with these generated through direct translation of some classes
          (e.g., broadleaved forest) from the land cover map or by splitting mapped classes using contextual information
          (e.g., the extent of peatlands or coastal environments).

          Compare maps of land cover or habitats for any two dates to highlight areas of significant change and explore
          the evidence for change impacts and driving pressures.

          All Living Earth layers are openly available and accessible for people to use but also to view current and
          historical changes in the national landscape over varying time periods and understand the reasons for these.

        <p class="subtitle">
          The legends used for land cover and change are globally relevant as they are based on the Food and Agriculture
          Organisation (FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) and Living Earthâ€™s Global Change Taxonomy. The
          taxonomies used for habitats maps (where existing) are specific to the country.

        <p class="subtitle">
          The maps can be used for multiple purposes, including assessing past and current land management and use and
          impacts on carbon, biodiversity and soil, water and air quality. They can also inform local, national and
          international policy.

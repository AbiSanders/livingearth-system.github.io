      Living Earth is a novel globally applicable concept and and approach that provides information on landscapes to inform on past changes and can inform direct future actions for our Planet that benefit the well being of nature and people.  Living Earth uses globally consistent taxonomies for classifying past, current and future land cover and change.  The approach is simple in that maps of landscapes (e.g., land cover, habitats) can be constructed from environmental descriptors retrieved or classified primarily from Earth observations and are scalable in space and time because of the use of defined units or categories.   Comparisons of the spatial dataets allow evidence on change impacts to be gathered, which can be combined with information on driving pressures to ascertain causes and consequences. This information, which is open, can inform decisions relating to the planning of future landscapes under a range of economic and/or climate scenarios, assess values of ecosystems, assess the realism of ambitions and ecosystem values, and monitor progress towards co-designed plans.

## Non Photosynthetic Vegetation

![Non Photosynthetic Vegetation](/assets/img/wales/big/non-photosynthetic-vegetation.jpg)

##### Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation (NPV) is defined as the vegetation cover which does not take part into photosynthesis process.

It is composed of dormant, senescent or dead vegetation, as well as the woody parts of plants (trunks, stems and branches). NPV can occur within a green canopy or outside (e.g., as woody debris following vegetation clearance or dead grass following drying).  The amount and proportion of NPV impacts on Earth processes, particularly climate and ecosystem functioning as it influences carbon, water and nutrient fluxes, the frequency and intensity of fires, degrees of soil erosion, and quality of wildlife habitat.  

Unit: _Ratio or percentage_

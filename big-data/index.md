header="The Open Data Cube is used by CSIRO’s Earth Analytics Science and Innovation (EASI), Geoscience Australia’s Digital Earth Australia (DEA) and the Welsh Data Cube (WDC) analysis platforms to provide access to the full archive of time series of Landsat sensor, Sentinel-1 radar and/or Sentinel-2 optical satellite ARD.
Living Earth has recently demonstrated capacity to generate land and water classifications using the Open Data Cube in Papua New Guinea using EASI, which are consistent with those being generated for Australia (through DEA) and Wales (through the WDC). "

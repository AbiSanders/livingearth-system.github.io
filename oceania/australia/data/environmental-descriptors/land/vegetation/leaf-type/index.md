                    <p>Leaf type is defined as the type of leaf morphology. It is mainly linked to the botanical group of plants (<i>Angiosperm</i> and <i>Gymnosperm</i>).</p>
                    <p>The two main types of leaves are the broadleaves and the needle-leaves. Broadleaves is the most common type of leaves that can be encountered on flowering plants. Broadleaves are flat and broad. On another hand, needle-leaved plants have leaves shaped like needles that are, most of the time, persistent during winter.</p>
                    <p>Leaf type can be identified from ground observations (see <a href="https://livingearth.aber.ac.uk/data/ground-measurements/technics/leaf-type-ground-measurement/" target="_blank">here</a>) but can also be determined through satellite/airborne-derived images.</p>

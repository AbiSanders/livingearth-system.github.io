    The ESA CCI Biomass project [link to esa.cci.int/biomass) has generated global maps of above ground biomass (Mg ha-1) at 100 m spatial resolution for 2010 and annually from 2017 to 2020 with further years planned.  Establishing changes in AGB between years is problematic, particularly because different radar sensors were used in their generation and environmental conditions vary between years. Whilst not directly quantifying biomass change, Living Earthâ€™s Global Change Framework and Evidence-Based Change Framework is providing evidence for the types of changes occurring, using the detailed land cover maps for Australia and Wales to guide development of the change algorithms. Knowledge of the reasons for change is also been obtained by referencing pressure datasets obtained from a diverse range of sources, including Earth observations, expert knowledge and  citizen science records.

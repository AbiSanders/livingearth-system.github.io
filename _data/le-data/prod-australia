title: "LEVEL 3 CATEGORIES"
  subtitle: "The Level 3 categories for Australia are generated by using Landsat-derived mangrove extent and annual fractional vegetation and bare surface cover and water hydoperiod to identify areas of vegetation and water respectively.  Cultivated areas and artificial surfaces are identified using machine learning algorithms"

- title: "MANGROVES"
  subtitle: "For the Australian mainland and island coasts, mangroves were mapped within a habitat mask defined initially by the Global Mangrove Watch.  Mangrove extent for each year was then mapped from the green vegetaton fractional cover "

- title: "CANOPY COVER (%)"
  subtitle: "The cover of terrestrial vegetation was estimated from the photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic fractional cover, whist that of mangroves (aquatic vegetation) was based on a relationship with LIDAR planimetric canopy cover. "

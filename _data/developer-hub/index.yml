  content: "The ambition of Living Earth is to create “algorithms for countries”, with focus specifically on those that retrieve or classify environmental descriptors as these are then automatically used to generate the land cover and change maps.   This allows each country to have access to the best available algorithms with this facilitating advancement and succession planning and implementation.  Hence, countries are then provided with the best available capacity to consistently characterize, map, monitor and plan their landscapes.  As global taxonomies are used, algorithms can be exchanged between countries and outputs compared. Validation, including through the Earthtrack mobile app can also be achieved in a consistent and comparable way.  The section provides a link to the repositories for each country.."

  button: "The most ‘natural’ reference state for sessile oakwoods in Wales are ravine woodlands in the more ‘oceanic’ west of the country.  The best, and perhaps only, example is found at Devils Bridge in Ceredigion.  Here the wood experiences high levels of humidity as a consequence of a waterfall running through the valley and remains unmanaged, in terms of felling at least, due the steep nature of the valley sides.   However, while the steep-sided valley effectively prevents timber felling, it also prevents the removal unwanted species, such as Rhododendron ponticum.  So this wood is an example of how the habitat would develop in the absence of an active management programme – or as a consequence of ‘rewilding’."

  title: "Agricultural grasslands"
  subtitle: "The vast majority of grassland habitats in Wales are agriculturally-improved and support little of biodiversity interest for either the fauna or flora. The loss of species-rich hay meadows from the Welsh landscape is well documented, with more than 95% being lost, primarily through conversion to silage and permanent pasture, since the 1950s. Of those that remain, many are degrading in quality, either through eutrophication (from neighboring fields and/or nitrogen depositions), or from neglect. Vast tracts of grassland in Wales are now virtually barren of biodiversity interest and it is now possible to drive around the Welsh countryside for hours in winter and not see a flock of thrushes, finches, larks or buntings such is the damage caused by decades of overgrazing, ploughing, reseeding, fertiliser treatments and pesticide applications."

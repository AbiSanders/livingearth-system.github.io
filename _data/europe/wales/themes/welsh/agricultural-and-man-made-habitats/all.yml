  title: "Arable Habitats"
  subtitle: "According to the latest agricultural statistics, the area of agricultural habitats in Wales is 1,677, 072 ha, which represents c.80% of the land area, which increases to 88% when common land is included. These habitats comprise a mix of arable habitats, permanent grassland, rough grazings, woodland, scrub and hedgerows. Hay meadows and pastures, which are also considered in the section on semi-natural habitat components, have been included here because they are essentially agricultural habitats and would not exist without the appropriate management regimes. The more common states of arable, grassland and hedgerow habitats are outlined in the sections below."

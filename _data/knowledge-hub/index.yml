  content: >
    New to Aberystwyth University Masters in Remote Sensing and GIS: Living Earth: Past and Future Environmental Monitoring. This new module introduces students to a sequence of steps involving:
    
    a. Generating or accessing Earth observation data in an Analysis Ready Data (ARD) format.
    
    b. Retrieving or classifying environmental descriptors from these data.
    
    c. Classifying land covers, including through environmental descriptors, and translating to habitats.
    
    d. Detecting and describing change impacts and driving pressures based on evidence.
    
    e. Validating the resulting thematic products through ground and remote observations.
    
    The module explains locally relevant frameworks for classifying land covers (the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) and detecting, describing, mapping and monitoring change (a Global Change Taxonomy and Evidence-Based Change Framework). The module also connects to a wide range of stakeholders and interest groups, from the public through to those involved in national and international land management and policy.

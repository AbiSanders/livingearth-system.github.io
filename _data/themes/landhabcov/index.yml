  content: "Geoscience Australia's Digital Earth Australia has generated 33 years of 30 m resolution land cover maps from the entire archive of Landsat sensor data acquired over the Australian continent and islands.  These maps demonstrate the power of the Living Earth approach as a large diversity of changes associated with bush fires, urban expansion and coastal dynamics are revealed.

#  subtitle: "National mapping of Wales through Living Earth"
  content: "For Wales, national maps of habitats have been generated, with these generated through direct translation from selected FAO LCCS land cover classes, more detailed classification of dominant plant communities within vegetated areas mapped as semi-natural and separation into habitat categories (where needed) by referencing contextual information including the Wales Peat Map and the original Phase 1 Habitat Surveyâ€™s delineation of coastal environments and degrees of grassland acidity.  The maps have been generated through the newly established Welsh Data Cube and provide capacity for ongoing monitoring of habitats, annually but also subannually."

  content: "Through the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Biomass project, and partnering with the University of Leicester, ESA CCI Land Cover mapa at 300 m spatial resolution have been deconstructed into environmental descriptors and then reconstructed into a global map using the Living Earth approach.  When reconstructing, a diverse range of other data layers have been used including mangrove extent (from Global Mangrove Watch) and tree canopy density.  Further descriptions of these classes have been obtained using, for example, the CCI Biomass maps from 2010 and annually from 2018 to 2020)."

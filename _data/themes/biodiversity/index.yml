  content: "The provision of high-resolution maps of environmental descriptors by Living Earth, coupled with a wealth of species data points held by Local Environmental Record Centres, offers the opportunity to explore species distribution modelling. This approach can make use of diverse modelling techniques to offer considerable insight into the potential geographic ranges of species, human impacts on these, and inform future landscape planning."

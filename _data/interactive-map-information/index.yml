  subtitle: "Our Interactive map of the country provides a platform for visualizing how people and nature have shaped the landscapes we see today. These maps have been obtained primarily from historical satellite data and are updated through near daily observations.

  
  Initially, select the broad land cover as the base map, and then add layers that represent different categorical (e.g., crop type) or continuous (e.g., water persistence, above ground biomass) environmental descriptors to give more detail. See the video for a

  
  View maps of habitat extent (for Wales only), with these generated through direct translation of some classes (e.g., broadleaved forest) from the land cover map or by splitting mapped classes using contextual information (e.g., the extent of peatlands or coastal environments).


  Compare maps of land cover or habitats for any two dates to highlight areas of significant change and explore the evidence for change impacts and driving pressures.

  
  See the video for a step-by-step guide to displaying the environmental descriptors and maps of land cover, habitats and change."

- title: "The uniqueness of Living Earth legends"
  subtitle: "The legends used for land cover and change are globally relevant as they are based on the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) and Living Earthâ€™s Global Change Taxonomy. The taxonomies used for habitats maps (where existing) are specific to the country."

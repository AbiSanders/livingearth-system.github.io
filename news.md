heading="Cyclone Jasper landslides"
subheading="Landslides resulting from Cyclone Jasper made landfall near Wujal Wujal, Cape York, with over 22500 mm of rainfall recorded in the Daintree region of Far North Queensland.  Many of the rivers in the region experienced extensive flooding, including the Barron, Daintree and Mossman, but also numerous landslides on the coast, erosion along river banks (particularly those without vegetation) and large amounts of sediment deposited along the riverbanks and coast.   The Living Coasts Team recorded information on change impacts and associated pressures using the Earthtrack mobile application and these can be viewed at https://earthtrack.aber.ac.uk/lccs/world.html."

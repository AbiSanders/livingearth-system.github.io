heading="Cyclone Jasper landslides"
subheading="Cyclone Jasper made landfall near Wujal Wujal, Cape York, with over 22500 mm of rainfall recorded in the Daintree region of Far North Queensland.  Many of the rivers in the region experienced extensive flooding, including the Barron, Daintree and Mossman, but landslides were also numerous, erosion occurred along the river banks (particularly those without vegetation) and large amounts of sediment were deposited in affected forests and along coast.   The Living Coasts Team recorded information on these change impacts and associated pressures using the Earthtrack mobile application and these can be viewed at https://earthtrack.aber.ac.uk/lccs/world.html."

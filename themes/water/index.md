header="Across landscapes, water occurs in liquid form and as snow and ice, and the properties of each are multi-dimensional, relating to the surface, column or volume or substate.  Respectively, these include water surface temperature and floating matter, columnar turbidity, acidity or snow grain size, and the composition and topography of the substrate. Plants and animals are also distributed on or throughout, with populations varying over space and time. Whilst the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) used by Living Earth allows for the classification of the different forms of water, these are relatively limited and categorical in nature.  Hence, Living Earth (including through the Living Coasts, Living Watersources and Dynamic Land projects with international partners) has extended capacity to consistently describe freshwater, intertidal and marine environments from environmental descriptors retrieved or classified from Earth observation or obtained from other sources.

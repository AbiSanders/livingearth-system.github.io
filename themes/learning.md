            <p>Living Wales provides a wide range of teaching and learning resources relevant to primary school years through to universities and professional training. These contribute to the objectives of Living Wales, which are to a) provide educational material for primary and secondary schools that encourages interest in and provide the basic knowledge surrounding Earth observation and b) significantly increase Earth observation and associated technology training in Welsh universities and colleges. Living Wales is also encouraging the use of art to support interpretation, use and uptake of EO data by the wider community.</p>

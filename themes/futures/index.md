header="Living Earth has developed a logical pathway to support the sustainable use of landscapes and restoration of ecosystems going forward.  The main component are: 

a) Imagining  or future landscapes and revisiting visions as needed.
b) Informing decisions by providing capacity to value landscapes (e.g., in terms of carbon, biodiversity, coastal protection, water quality).
c) Assessing risk, including from economic variations (including shocks) and climate change. 
d) Exploring the realism of proposed landscapes under different scenarios of change (e.g., through reference to past EO-derived knowledge and model scenarios to test proposed management interventions).
f) Harmonising viewpoints through co-design and by resolving conflicts.
g) Monitoring progress towards ambitions.

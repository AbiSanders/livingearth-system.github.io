header="Different species have different habitat requirements or ecological niches, some of which are clearly defined in the scientific literature. Habitat mapping undertaken as part of the Living Earth project can help to delineate expected ranges of often-iconic species and improve our understanding of actual or realised species distribution. This may include the response of habitats and/or species to climate change, incorporating invaluable time series of data held by Local Environmental Records Centres."

header="Living PNG outputs  represent a contribution to monitoring, reporting and verifying (MRV) the status of national carbon stocks  as part of their National Determined Contributions (NDCs) and Emission inventory obligations. 

The analytical capacity is delivered through the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisationâ€™s (CSIRO) Earth Analytics Science and Innovation (EASI) platform, which utilises the capacity of the Open Data Cube (ODC) to make available analysis ready data (ARD) from multiple Earth Observation data series.  Included are relevant algorithms, scripts and user interfaces for the integration/refinement of existing mangrove maps and other blue carbon products into a broad land cover product generated using the Living Earth approach.

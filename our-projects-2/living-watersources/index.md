header="Particular focus is on retrieving or classifying environmental descriptors relevant to freshwater systems from Earth observation data.  Physical descriptors include stream water velocities, discharge volumes and water turbidity whilst chlorophyll concentrations associated with green algae and cyanobacteria are amongst the biological descriptors.  Chemical descriptors (e.g., mineral and/or nutrient concentrations) are more difficult to obtain from satellite or airborne sensors and so consideration is being given to relationships with amounts modeled from samples (manual or sensed in situ) or through indirect relationships with measurable properties (e.g., water turbidity).  The project is working to gather evidence of change impacts specific to freshwater rivers, lakes and reservoirs including sedimentation, salinisation, changes in water extent and/or amount and water quality change.  Evidence is also being sought for the pressures leading to these changes, with abstraction, deposition, evaporation, construction, dredging, nutrification and dam removal being examples.  Consideration is also being given to impacts and pressures occurring in the watershed, including vegetation amount loss as a result of forest clearing or erosion because of flooding  Through case study demonstrations, the project will establish the impact-pressure combinations, defined in Living Earthâ€™s Global Change Taxonomy, that can be mapped routinely using primarily the Sentinel-1 radar and Sentinel-2 optical data accumulating within the Welsh Data Cube. Knowledge of past change impacts and pressures will be used to inform the planning of future landscapes and how this can be best undertaken to support sustained improvements in water quality and landscape integrity.  A component is to establish the contributions that Living Wales can make to a digital twin of the Welsh landscape."

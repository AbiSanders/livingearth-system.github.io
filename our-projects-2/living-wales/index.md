header="Living Wales provides direct benefit for the Welsh environment, economy, policy, society and well-being and a freely available and publicly accessible resource. To ensure that Wales, and specifically the Welsh Government, receives continued support and contributions from world-leading, UK-wide and international science, Living Wales is developing components that include: a) provisioning full and open access to Sentinel-1/2 and Landsat satellite sensor Analysis Ready Data (ARD)in near real-time and historically; b) routinely retrieving environmental descriptors from these to construct 10 m annual and sub-annual national land cover and evidence-based change classifications according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Land Cover Classification System ; and c) providing national capacity for validation through the use of very high resolution airborne and spaceborne data and the Earthtrack mobile applications .   Capacity has also been introduced to respond to the needs of multiple stakeholders in Wales, including through provision of spatial evidence for supporting local, national and international policy, environmental protection, conservation and restoration, and emergency response. A major component has been to embed the Living Wales infrastructure and functionality within Welsh Government to facilitate ongoing, in-house, operational monitoring capability.  Significant engagement, education, training and other knowledge transfer has been undertaken, including through establishment of dedicated professional and higher education training courses and continued development of the Living Wales Education and Training Centre (at the Centre for Alternative Technology (CAT)).

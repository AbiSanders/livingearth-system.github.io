##Leaf Area Index 

The Leaf Area Index (LAI) is defined as the total area of one-sided leaves per ground surface area.

It is a fundamental property of the plant canopy playing a key role in the absorption of solar radiation, through photosynthesis, and thus in vegetation growth. Typically, the LAI ranges from 0 to up to 10 for non-vegetated areas and very dense vegetated areas respectively but can be as high as 22.

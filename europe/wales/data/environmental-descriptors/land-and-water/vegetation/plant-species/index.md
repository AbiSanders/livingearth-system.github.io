## Plant Species

![Plant Species](/assets/img/wales/big/plant-species.jpg)

##### Plant species are defined as categories of plants which show common attributes and which are called by a common name.

Plant species diversity is important for maintaining genetic diversity and wildlife habitats, limiting disease propagation, and regulating a large range of ecosystem functions. Moreover, as plant species are sensitive to environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, rainfall, soil acidity), they are often used as indicators of environmental changes.

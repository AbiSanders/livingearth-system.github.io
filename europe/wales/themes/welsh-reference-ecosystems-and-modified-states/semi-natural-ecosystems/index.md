subheading="Wales has a diverse range of semi-natural ecosystems, with these including forests, woodlands, scrub and bracken, grasslands, heaths and mires, fens and swamps, as well as standing water and water courses.  Around the coast, the main habitats are coastal dunes, cliffs, boulder fields and screens and those associated with intertidal areas.  Recognising the value of these habitats and providing a benchmark for targeting restoration is critical, particularly as many of the reference states no longer occur and hence this knowledge is depleted through generations."

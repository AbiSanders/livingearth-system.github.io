However, the abundance and distribution of fauna and flora has reduced overall over past decades; this is often piecemeal and therefore the full extent of change is not always evident. The environmental descriptors and land cover maps generated by Living Wales provide a valuable and expanding resource by which to understand where our biodiversity is located and how to reverse declines, and simultaneously also highlight successes so that we can build on these."
